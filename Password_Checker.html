            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The **Password Checker Project** is a Python-based tool designed to check if a password has been
                compromised in any known data breaches. By leveraging the Python libraries `requests` and `hashlib`,
                this project makes use of the Pwned Passwords API to verify password security efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>
                Developing this project was both an exciting and challenging experience. Here are a few challenges I
                encountered:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    **API Integration**: Initially, I struggled with understanding how to integrate external APIs into a
                    Python project using `requests`. After some trial and error, I managed to get a solid grasp of how
                    the API communicates with the program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Security Considerations**: Managing sensitive data, such as passwords, meant I had to implement
                    hashing using `hashlib` to ensure no plain-text password was sent to the API. This added an extra
                    layer of complexity but was crucial for ensuring security.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Error Handling**: Handling unexpected responses from the API (e.g., network errors or invalid
                    responses) required robust error-handling mechanisms, which I initially overlooked. Over time, I
                    implemented the necessary try-except blocks to handle various cases.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="thought-process">
            <h2>My Thought Process</h2>
            <p>
                When building this project, my focus was on creating a functional, efficient, and secure tool that could
                check for password safety. I began by researching the Pwned Passwords API, understanding how it works,
                and planning how to hash passwords before sending them to the API. My goal was to make the program as
                intuitive as possible while maintaining security and performance.
